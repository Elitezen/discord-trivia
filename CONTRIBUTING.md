# Contributing to Discord Trivia

## What we would like to see in contributions
- Additions which improve the existing code in any way aslong as those changes do not cause other conflicts.
- Library features or improvements not considered gimmick or unessesary.
- Refactors to messy procedures/functions.
- Typo fixes 

## Do not commit
- Work that will cause conflicts with other functions or files.
- Work that drastically changes the framework already layed out in by library.
- Work that is incomplete or does not fully work.

Remember to run `npm run prettier` before building and commiting to `main`
