# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.3
- Fixed bug causing error message "Invalid Root!"
- Compilation now targets ES2020

## 2.0.0
  - Removed `TriviaCommandBuilder` as it's usage was verbose. I am waiting for Discord to allow implementation of select menus into modals to create a successor.
  - `TriviaGame.start()` has been renamed to `TriviaGame.setup()` 
  - Configuration of a `TriviaGame` is now done through:
    - `game.decorate(options: DecorationOptions)`
    - `game.setQuestionOptions(options: Omit<GameQuestionOptions, "customQuestions">)`
    - `game.setGameOptions(options: Partial<GameOptions>)`
    - Option names containing "maximum" or "minimum" have been reduced to  "max" and "min"
  - Adding custom questions is now done through `game.setCustomQuestions(questions: (
      CustomQuestion<QuestionTypes>
      | BooleanQuestion
      | MultipleChoiceQuestion
    )[])`
  - Package now uses open-trivia-db 2.1.5 which has reverted back to node-fetch@2 to support NodeJS < 18

- Editing the game's output messages can now be done through `game.setGameTexts(options: Partial<GameOptions>)`

- Trivia games now automatically move on to the next step once the queue has filled up or everyone has answered

- You can now edit the following using `game.decorate()`:
  - Button styles
  - Embed thumbnail

- Custom questions can now be created with the `CustomQuestionBuilder.Boolean()` and `CustomQuestionBuilder.Multiple()` classes

- This package now "echoes" `CategoryNames`, `QuestionDifficulties`, and `QuestionTypes` from open-trivia-db for usage in discord-trivia
